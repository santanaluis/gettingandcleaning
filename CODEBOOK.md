# Codebook - Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Modifications from original data

Datasets containing measurements for Tests and Training observations have been merged into one
Variables names have been updated in data set
Variables for mean and standard deviation (std) have been extracted from this data set
Activities have been binded using descriptive lablels
From this cleaner dataset, a new independent dataset has been extracted.
The new dataset reports means for the different measurements by subject and activity.

## Variable description 

The first column "Subject" identifies the subject by a given ID
The second column "Activity" identifies the activity performed by the subject
The remaining colums, from 3 to 81, correspond to the different means and std measurements:
